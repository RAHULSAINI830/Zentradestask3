Points taken care of:
1. The user name field only accept an email format and the validation is done through Javascript.
2. The password field is a masked field i.e. it does not reveals what the user is entering.
3. The password field does not accepts any special character other than '@' and only gets accepted when it contains an uppercase letter and a number.
4. Whenever the password 'SmartServTest@123' is enetered redirects the user to the dashboard page looking like:

5. Clicking on the 'Forgot your password' link sends the user to send an email to 'support@smartserv.io' for resetting the password. Looking like:

Email is only accepted if it is in the valid format i.e. it must contain one '@' and one '.' indicating an email being valid.

Whenever any incorrect password is entered, such an alert is shown
